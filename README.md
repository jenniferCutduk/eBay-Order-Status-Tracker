## How It Works  

1. **Input or Trigger —** The automation is initiated via the Appilot dashboard. The user selects one or multiple eBay accounts to track orders for.  
2. **Core Logic —** Appilot navigates through the eBay app or web dashboard using UI Automator or Appium, fetching order and shipment data automatically.  
3. **Output or Action —** The bot sends structured updates (e.g., “Order Shipped,” “Out for Delivery,” “Delivered”) to the connected system or dashboard.  
4. **Other functionalities —** Retry handling, error logging, and session management ensure smooth operation even in case of temporary API or network issues.
